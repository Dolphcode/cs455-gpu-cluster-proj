## Project: YOLOv8 Implementation with MPI + CUDA
The goal of this project is to construct a rough implementation of the YOLOv8 image detector model using MPI and CUDA (hopefully, CUDA-aware MPI towards the end for increased efficiency), and to compare our implementation with the existing implementation of the model both in efficiency of training passes and validation passes.

This `README.md` file will contain a chronological detailing/documentation of the implementation of this architecture.
