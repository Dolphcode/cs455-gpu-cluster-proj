# v0: Python Notebook

To run the code in this folder ideally we should be using a virtual environment. The following lines will setup and install all the requirements for the virtual environment.
```
mkdir .venv
python -m venv .venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
In general the virtual environment is activated using
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
